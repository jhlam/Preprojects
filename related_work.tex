RElated work, there are multiple people working on this kind of problem. One of the more well known is kemnp, where he tries to solve how to maximize the spread. 


Other solution include the hybrid FPGA-CPU arcitecture, which reduces teh computationtime for a bfs over a small world graph by XX\%\cite{YamanPOaper} 

As we can see, there are many different research around this subjects, altho there aren't many that looks at how to accelerate seed selection and the Independent cascade model in hardware, which we will look more at in the end of this report.
