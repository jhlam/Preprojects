\chapter{Background} \lable{chap_background}

In this chapter, we will look at the fundamental concepts and background information needed to understand the the different infections model, problem with seed-selection for social graphs, and solving Breadth-first search using matrix multiplication.

\section{Network}
Network is a collection of nodes with edges connecting them together\cite{TheStrucandcomplex}. A social network is . 

\section{Data diffusion}
Datta diffusion is looking at how information is propagated through a network or a graph. An example would be how a new internett meme, a new trend or how a new disease is spread through a community. The process consist of a set of starter nodes that are \"infected\", during each timestep, there are a chance that the \"infected\" node would \"infect\" its neighbour. 

\section{Basic Diffusion Models}
When we talk about information propagation, we can look at how medical and technological innovations is spread through a social network. We can simulate those kind of behaviour with different diffusion models. There are two basic diffusion models used to simulate the propagation of informaiton through a network\cite{kempe}, the {\it linear threshold model} and the {\it independent cascade model}\cite{kempe}.

This process can be simulated by looking at a social network and how information propagetes through the network. A social network is a graph of relationship and interactions within a group of individuals. 
We look at each node in the graph as a person, they can be either active, or inactive. The activation of a node depends on which diffusion model we choose.

The linear threshold model uses a threshold $\theta_v$ bewteen the interval [0,1], which represent the faction of {\it v}'s neighbors that need to be active to activate node{\it v}. The Linear Threshold Model activates the current node {\it v} when the weight{\it b_{v,w}} $> \theta$ from its neighbour {\it w} outweights the $\theta_v$. 

The independent cascade model changes states with a probability $p_{\it v, w}$, where {\it v }is current node, and {\it w} is it's neighbor. During each propagation, the node {\it v} have a  $p_{\it v, w}$ chance to change state if the neighbour {\it w} changed state. If during timestep {\it t} a node {\it v} changed state, its neighbour {\it w} would have a  $p_{\it v, w}$ chance to change state in the next time stepp. 

\section{Breadth First Search as a matrix multiplication.}
By looking at the 	connectivity matrix, we can se that a connectivity matrix is a graph represented in a matrix format. The BFS can be achived by looking at the BFS operations as a matrix multiplication \cite{algoToMath}. If we look at the graph as a connectivity matrix, we can apply matrixe multiplication to generate the breadth first search. 

\section{SIR/SIS}
There are two different epidemic model that we will be looking at, the {\it SIR} ( susceptible, infected, removed,) and the SIS mode(susceotible, infected, susceptible). The SIR model stands for susceptible, infected and removed. The node would have three different states, the susceptible state mean that the node is susceptible to the disease, or in this example, change state. The infected state is the state were the node {\it v} is infected. The state Removed/Recovered, is the state were the node {\it v} have the diseas removed, or have recover from the infection. In this model, the Removed/Recovered state is not susvveptible to the infection again.
