\chapter{Conclution}
As we have shown in this report, there are multiple different algorithms to select the seed. Information diffusion can simulate different aspect of real life. The problem is very taxing on a normal home computer. BFS can be optimized, ICM is a special case of the BFS. There are different optimization, matrix multiplication, maybe something with hardware.
